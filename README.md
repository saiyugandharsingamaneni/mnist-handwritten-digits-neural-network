# mnist-handwritten-digits-neural-network

* This is a 3 layers Sequential Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset.
* I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.
* It achieved 98.73% of accuracy with this ANN trained on a CPU, which took me about a minute.
