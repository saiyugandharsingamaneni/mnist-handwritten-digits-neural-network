# mnist-handwritten-digits-neural-network
* MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits ranging from the number 0 to 9.
* It has a training set of 60,000 images, and 10,000 test images that are classified into corresponding categories or labels.
* To use the MNIST dataset in Keras, an API is provided to download and extract images and labels automatically.
* The following Keras code shows how to access MNIST dataset, plot 25 random samples, and count the number of labels for train and test datasets.
# Description
* This is a 3 layers Sequential Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset.
* I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.
* It achieved 97.53% of accuracy with this ANN trained on a CPU, which took me about a minute.
